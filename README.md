# basic-games
This is a collection of computer games written in classic BASIC language.  Some of you will no doubt remember Dave Ahl's "101 BASIC Computer Games", and this is the source of at least some of them.

These are not original, and in many cases, the original author(s) is/are unknown, so I can't credit them.

In a couple of cases, I have created modified versions of the games to get them to work on specific machines.  Most would work under GWBASIC, Applesoft BASIC and the like.

If you find and fix a problem, please create a PR for consideration.
